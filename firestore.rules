/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where all data is private by default.
 * Users can only access data that exists within their own user document tree. This ensures a high level of
 * security and data isolation between users.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized hierarchically. A top-level 'users' collection stores user profile
 * documents. All other user-specific data, such as 'issues', is stored in subcollections under that
 * user's specific document (e.g., /users/{userId}/issues/{issueId}).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin User Listing: To allow admins to manage users, a special rule grants 'list' access on the
 *   'users' collection only to authenticated users whose own document has a 'role' field set to 'admin'.
 *   This is a secure way to grant broad access to a privileged few.
 * - Path-Based Security: Ownership is determined by the document's path. This is the most secure and
 *   performant method, as it avoids costly 'get' calls to other documents for authorization checks.
 * - Relational Integrity: On document creation and updates, rules ensure that internal ownership fields
 *   (e.g., a 'userId' field within an issue document) match the document's path, preventing data
 *   inconsistencies and potential security loopholes.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The hierarchical structure (/users/{userId}/...) is a form of
 * structural denormalization. By placing a user's data in a subcollection, the ownership (userId) is
 * inherently part of the path, making authorization checks simple and fast without needing extra fields
 * or document reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: User-specific data ('issues') is stored in a private subcollection under the
 * user's document. This is more secure and performant than a single top-level 'issues' collection,
 * as it prevents any possibility of one user accidentally listing another user's private data.
