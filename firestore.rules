/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where all data is private by default.
 * Users can only access data that exists within their own user document tree. This ensures a high level of
 * security and data isolation between users.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized hierarchically. A top-level 'users' collection stores user profile
 * documents. All other user-specific data, such as 'issues', is stored in subcollections under that
 * user's specific document (e.g., /users/{userId}/issues/{issueId}).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin User Listing via Hardcoded Email: To allow admins to list users, we check the authenticated
 *   user's email against a hardcoded list. This is secure and works without needing custom claims
 *   or database reads within the list rule, which is not allowed.
 * - Path-Based Security: Ownership is determined by the document's path. This is the most secure and
 *   performant method, as it avoids costly 'get' calls to other documents for authorization checks.
 * - Relational Integrity: On document creation and updates, rules ensure that internal ownership fields
 *   (e.g., a 'userId' field within an issue document) match the document's path, preventing data
 *   inconsistencies and potential security loopholes.
